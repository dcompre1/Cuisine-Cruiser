# Cuisine Cruiser

Cuisine Cruiser is a random recipe generator made for hungry users who are unsure of what they want to eat. 
The generator uses [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to provide a list of ingredients, instructions, and a YouTube tutorial (if available) to help the user prepare their recipe. 
It also allows the user to input preferences like ingredient(s) to avoid and desired cuisine type.
